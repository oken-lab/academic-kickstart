### Biography
Andrea is a first year PhD student in the Graduate Group in Ecology and a Sustainable Oceans NRT Trainee. She earned her BS in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences from the University of Washington in 2018 and worked as a lab technician at Scripps Institution of Oceanography before coming to Davis. Through her research, she seeks to better understand the ecological shifts that exploited fish populations and communities may experience in a rapidly changing environment and how these changes may introduce them to new fishing pressures. Outside of the lab, she is typically found outside playing soccer or volleyball, checking out the food scene, or exploring new places.
